## Practice project for Vue learninig

### **_Introduction_**
After finishing The Net Ninja - Vue Beginner Tutorial, I was not fully ready to jump to my own big side-project. I needed to practice more, mainly the composition API and fetching data part. I found an a fake store API - where I could get the products and render it with Vue. I tried to add some functionality, like search by name or category

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. VUE


**Aim of the Project**
It is a practice mini project to get more hands-on experience with Vue.

**Challenges within the Project**
Fetching data and rendering it was here and there quite a headache.

## **_What have I learned_**
Vue and more Vue

## Deployed: in the future
